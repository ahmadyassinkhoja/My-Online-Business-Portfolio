        Gaby is a highly experienced and creative coder. He is spontaneous in
        his decisions and believes in body asleep mind awake. He is willing to
        participate in any hackathons near him. If you give him a pc and put
        Pink Floyd music, he will write the best code.

        As a web developer, I intend to use my obsessive attention to detail, my
        unequivocal love for making things, and my mission-driven work ethic to
        literally change the world.
